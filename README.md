Hello sir,
I have done the task. due to time limit, some errors occure and some function is not working.

In my project, I use Json web server to store data.
Initially some dummy data is provided to view our user table.

To Run json server, you need to open the "server" folder inside the file. and then take the command prompt inside "server" folder. and run the code => npm start

# server folder -> command prompt  -> # npm start 

# npm start 

The server is reday at http://localhost:3000

After that it can fetch data from the server


In my project, their are 4 components all-user, add-user, edit-user & navbar.
our home page (http://localhost:4200) is set to "all-user-component". and provide path for routing.

We use modules like ReactiveFormsModule,FormsModule, HttpClientModule for the functioning.

Here I use Bootstrap for styling.

Also for add-user component I use Validator for advanced validation


HttpClientModule that allow us to perform http request and manipulate those requests and their responses.
